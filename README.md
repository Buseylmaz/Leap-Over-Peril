# **Leap Over Peril**
This game is the third project I've developed as part of the "Unity Learn Junior Programmer" program. It was created with the aim of enhancing my skills. No additional features were added to the project; I only adjusted the code to my preferences. I implemented manager systems for audio, hearts (lives), and score.

## **How To Play**
* In this game, various obstacles move towards the player at a constant speed from different points on the screen. The player's objective is to avoid these obstacles and collect points without losing all their lives. To enhance the gameplay experience, I added a background scrolling script to give the impression of movement even when the player is stationary. Additionally, I implemented a script for repetitive actions.

* I also improved the code structure by incorporating sound managers, which contributed to a cleaner and more organized codebase. Particle systems were integrated to enhance visual effects during gameplay.

* The game was developed as part of the "Unity Learn Junior Programmer" program to enhance my skills without adding additional features beyond personal optimizations and enhancements to existing code.
